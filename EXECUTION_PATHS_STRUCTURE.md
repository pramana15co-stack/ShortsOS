# Execution Paths Content Structure

This document defines the content structure for Execution Paths—step-by-step, stage-aware playbooks that guide creators toward specific goals.

## Structure Overview

Each Execution Path follows a consistent structure designed to provide clarity, reduce confusion, and enable confident execution. The structure emphasizes guidance over automation and explicitly states constraints to build trust.

---

## Path: "Beginner Shorts Path (0 → First Consistent Views)"

### 1. Who This Path Is For

**Purpose:** Clearly identify the target creator profile to ensure the path is appropriate.

**Content:**
- Creators with 0-100 subscribers
- No consistent posting history (fewer than 10 published Shorts)
- Unclear about which formats work for their niche
- Feeling overwhelmed by conflicting advice
- Wanting to establish a foundation before scaling

**Why this matters:** Prevents creators from using strategies meant for more advanced stages, reducing frustration and wasted effort.

---

### 2. Goal of the Path

**Purpose:** Define the specific, measurable outcome this path leads to.

**Content:**
- **Primary Goal:** Achieve consistent views (100-500 views per video) on a regular basis
- **Success Indicators:**
  - At least 3 videos in the last 2 weeks reach 100+ views
  - Views are coming from browse/suggested (not just subscribers)
  - Completion rate above 60% on at least 2 videos
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks of consistent execution

**Why this matters:** Sets realistic expectations and provides clear success criteria, avoiding vague promises of "going viral."

---

### 3. Weekly Focus Breakdown

**Purpose:** Provide a structured sequence that eliminates decision fatigue and ensures steady progress.

**Content:**

#### Week 1-2: Foundation
- **Focus:** Establish consistency and learn basic format structure
- **Actions:**
  - Post 2-3 videos per week using the "Hook + Value" format
  - Focus on one niche topic
  - Study your first 4-6 videos' analytics (views, retention, CTR)
- **Outcome:** Build the posting habit and understand basic performance metrics

#### Week 3-4: Format Mastery
- **Focus:** Master one format before trying others
- **Actions:**
  - Continue with "Hook + Value" format
  - Experiment with different hooks (question, statement, problem-solution)
  - Identify which hook style gets the best retention
- **Outcome:** Understand what works for your specific niche and audience

#### Week 5-6: Optimization
- **Focus:** Improve what's working, not pivot to new formats
- **Actions:**
  - Double down on your best-performing hook style
  - Improve pacing based on retention graphs
  - Test different thumbnails (if applicable)
- **Outcome:** Refine your approach based on data, not guesswork

#### Week 7-8: Consistency Validation
- **Focus:** Prove you can maintain consistent performance
- **Actions:**
  - Maintain 2-3 posts per week
  - Track if views are becoming more consistent
  - Document what's working for future reference
- **Outcome:** Establish a repeatable process that generates consistent views

**Why this matters:** Breaks down a multi-week journey into manageable weekly focuses, preventing overwhelm and ensuring steady progress.

### 4. Recommended Content Formats

**Purpose:** Provide stage-appropriate format recommendations with clear reasoning.

**Content:**

#### Primary Format: Hook + Value
- **Why at this stage:** Simple structure, easy to execute, teaches fundamental Shorts principles
- **Structure:** Strong hook (0-3s) → Value delivery (3-45s) → Clear CTA or conclusion
- **Best for:** Educational content, tips, quick wins
- **Execution guide:** [Link to format detail page]

#### Secondary Format: Problem-Solution
- **When to use:** After mastering Hook + Value (Week 4+)
- **Why:** Builds on Hook + Value structure, adds narrative element
- **Structure:** Problem statement → Solution demonstration → Result/outcome
- **Best for:** Tutorials, how-tos, troubleshooting

**Format Constraints:**
- Do NOT attempt: Complex formats (Story Arcs, Multi-Part Series) until you've mastered basics
- Do NOT mix: Multiple formats in the same week—master one at a time

**Why this matters:** Stage-appropriate recommendations prevent beginners from attempting formats that require skills they haven't developed yet.

---

### 5. What NOT to Do at This Stage

**Purpose:** Explicitly state constraints and common mistakes to prevent wasted effort and build trust.

**Content:**

#### Content Strategy Mistakes
- **Don't:** Try to go viral with trending sounds or topics outside your niche
  - **Why:** Inconsistent content confuses the algorithm and prevents audience building
- **Don't:** Post daily if it means sacrificing quality
  - **Why:** 2-3 quality videos per week beats 7 rushed videos that hurt your channel
- **Don't:** Switch formats every video
  - **Why:** You need data to learn what works; constant switching prevents pattern recognition

#### Technical Mistakes
- **Don't:** Spend hours on editing when simple cuts work
  - **Why:** At this stage, content structure matters more than production value
- **Don't:** Use complex transitions or effects
  - **Why:** Focus on hook, pacing, and value delivery first

#### Growth Strategy Mistakes
- **Don't:** Focus on subscriber count over views
  - **Why:** Views from browse/suggested are more valuable for growth at this stage
- **Don't:** Buy views, subscribers, or engagement
  - **Why:** Artificial metrics hurt your channel's long-term performance
- **Don't:** Compare your early results to established creators
  - **Why:** Different stages require different strategies; comparison leads to wrong decisions

**Why this matters:** Explicitly stating what to avoid builds trust, prevents common mistakes, and saves creators time and frustration.

### 6. How to Evaluate Progress

**Purpose:** Provide clear, objective criteria for assessing whether the path is working.

**Content:**

#### Weekly Checkpoints

**Week 2 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Posted at least 4 videos in 2 weeks
- [ ] At least 2 videos have 50+ views
- [ ] Average retention above 40%
- **If not met:** Review format structure and hook effectiveness

**Week 4 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Posted consistently (2-3x/week) for 4 weeks
- [ ] At least 3 videos have 100+ views
- [ ] Views are coming from browse/suggested (check analytics)
- [ ] Identified which hook style works best
- **If not met:** Focus on hook improvement and niche clarity

**Week 6 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] At least 5 videos have 100+ views
- [ ] Completion rate above 60% on 2+ videos
- [ ] Consistent posting habit established
- [ ] Clear understanding of what works for your niche
- **If not met:** Review format execution and consider niche focus

**Week 8 Checkpoint:**
- [ ] 3+ videos in last 2 weeks reached 100-500 views
- [ ] Views are consistent (not just one viral video)
- [ ] Completion rate stable above 60%
- [ ] Ready to move to next stage
- **If not met:** Continue path for 2 more weeks before moving on

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Views per video:** Target 100-500 by Week 8
- **Retention rate:** Target 60%+ average
- **Browse vs. Subscriber views:** Browse should be 70%+ by Week 6
- **Posting consistency:** 2-3 videos per week without gaps

**Why this matters:** Objective checkpoints prevent self-doubt, provide clear feedback, and help creators know if they're on track or need to adjust.

### 7. When to Move to the Next Stage

**Purpose:** Define clear criteria for progression to prevent premature advancement or getting stuck.

**Content:**

#### Ready to Move On When:
- ✅ **Consistency achieved:** 3+ videos in the last 2 weeks reached 100-500 views
- ✅ **Pattern established:** You understand which formats and hooks work for your niche
- ✅ **Habit formed:** Posting 2-3x/week feels sustainable, not forced
- ✅ **Data-driven:** You're making decisions based on analytics, not guesswork
- ✅ **Foundation solid:** You have a repeatable process for creating Shorts

#### Not Ready If:
- ❌ Views are inconsistent (one video gets 500 views, next gets 20)
- ❌ You haven't identified what works yet (still experimenting randomly)
- ❌ Posting is still a struggle (missing weeks, feeling overwhelmed)
- ❌ You're chasing trends instead of building a foundation

#### Next Stage Preview:
Once you've achieved consistent 100-500 views, you're ready for the **"Growing Shorts Path (First Views → Consistent Growth)"** which focuses on:
- Scaling to daily posting
- Expanding format variety
- Building audience engagement
- Optimizing for growth metrics

**Why this matters:** Clear progression criteria prevent creators from moving too fast (leading to failure) or staying too long (leading to stagnation).

## Design Principles

### 1. Guidance Over Automation
- Execution Paths provide structured guidance, not automated content generation
- Creators still make creative decisions; paths provide the framework

### 2. Stage-Aware Recommendations
- Every recommendation considers the creator's current stage
- What works at one stage may not work at another

### 3. Explicit Constraints
- Always state what NOT to do, not just what to do
- This builds trust and prevents common mistakes

### 4. Measurable Progress
- Every path includes clear checkpoints and success criteria
- Progress is evaluated objectively, not subjectively

### 5. Realistic Expectations
- No promises of virality or instant success
- Focus on steady, sustainable progress

### 6. Professional Tone
- Clear, confident, and structured
- Avoids hype language or exaggerated claims

## Implementation Notes

- This structure can be implemented as a dedicated page (e.g., `/execution-paths/beginner-shorts-path`)
- Each section should be clearly labeled and visually distinct
- Progress tracking could be integrated with user accounts
- Format recommendations should link to detailed format pages
- Weekly checkpoints could be interactive (checkboxes, progress bars)

---

## Future Paths

This structure serves as a template for additional Execution Paths:
- Growing Shorts Path (First Views → Consistent Growth)
- Scaling Shorts Path (Consistent Growth → Monetization)
- Niche-Specific Paths (e.g., "Tech Tutorial Path", "Fitness Shorts Path")
